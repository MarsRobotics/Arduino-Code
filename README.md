# Arduino-Code

This is the code that runs on the Arduinos for the Mars Robot. We use this code to run the motor controllers on the robot. The code has comments which provide more information about the motor controllers.

As for the actual pinout information, the 2019 robot has output sockets on the EE box according to the file named "Wheel Ports.txt"
