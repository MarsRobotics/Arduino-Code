For the robot's wheels, the output ports are arranged as follows:
Header: F = Front, M = Middle, B = Back
Subs: 	T = Top, B = Bottom
		D = Drive, A = Articulation

Note: 	Although we know that MLA is TM, it doesn't work (problem is inside the EE box, so there is not voltage output on the port), so it is an X.
		Also, the motor for the FLA has a broken lead.

	A: X
